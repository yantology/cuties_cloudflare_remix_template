# Chore

## Describe the chore

Switching the build tool from `webpack` to `vite` to improve build performance and simplify configuration.

## Additional context

* `vite` is a faster and lighter build tool compared to `webpack`.
* `vite` configuration is easier to understand and implement.
* This change will significantly improve build performance, resulting in faster build times.
* This change will not affect the application functionality.
