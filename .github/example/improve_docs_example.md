# Improve documentation

## Link

<https://github.com/dogokit/dogokit-remix/blob/main/app/routes/index.jsx#L10>

## Describe the problem

The documentation for the `createDog` function in `app/routes/index.jsx` is missing. This makes it difficult for new contributors to understand how to create a new dog object.

## Describe the improvement

Add JSDoc-style comments above the `createDog` function to explain:

- What the function does.
- What arguments it accepts.
- What the expected return value is.

For example:

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a new dog object.
 *
 * @param {string} name - The name of the dog.
 * @param {string} breed - The breed of the dog.
 * @param {number} age - The age of the dog in years.
 * @returns {object} The newly created dog object.
 */
const createDog = (name, breed, age) => {
  // ... function implementation
};
```

### Additional context

Providing clear documentation for functions, especially in a project like Dogokit which aims to be beginner-friendly, can greatly improve the developer experience and make it easier for people to contribute.
