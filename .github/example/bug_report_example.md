# Bug report

## Describe the bug

When I try to run the "simple-calculator" example code in the `examples` folder, the calculator does not display the result of the addition operation.

## To Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `examples/simple-calculator` folder.
3. Run the command `npm install`.
4. Run the command `npm start`.
5. Enter the numbers 5 and 3 into the input fields.
6. Click the "+" button to perform the addition operation.
7. The result displayed remains blank, it does not show the number 8.

## Expected behavior

The result of the addition 5 + 3 should be displayed on the screen, which is the number 8.

## Screenshots

[Attach screenshots if needed]

## System information

- OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Chrome
- Version of Node.js: 18.16.0

## Additional context

I have tried changing the HTML and JavaScript code related to the addition operation, but the result remains the same. I suspect there is an error in the JavaScript function that handles the addition operation.
