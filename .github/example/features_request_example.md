# Feature request

## Is the feature request related to a problem? Please describe

Currently, the "simple-calculator" application can only perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, the application does not yet have the functionality to perform more complex mathematical operations such as square roots, exponents, and logarithms. This makes it difficult for users who need more complex calculations.

## Describe the solution

I propose adding features to perform advanced mathematical operations such as:

* **Square root:**  A "âˆš" button that will calculate the square root of the input number.
* **Exponent:** An "^" button that allows users to calculate the exponent of a number.
* **Logarithm:** A "log" button that calculates the logarithm with base 10.

The display of these buttons can be adjusted to match the application's interface design.

## Describe alternatives considered

Another alternative considered is to direct users to use an online scientific calculator. However, this will reduce the practicality of the "simple-calculator" application, as users have to switch to another application to perform more complex calculations.

## Additional context

Adding these advanced mathematical operation features will greatly assist users who require more complex calculations, such as students, college students, and professionals in the fields of science and engineering. This will also enhance the functionality and usefulness of the "simple-calculator" application.
